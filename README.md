Weather app that displays the 24 hour forecast of a city

  This app is powered by the OpenWeatherMap API. It takes a city name or zip code and displays the 24 hour forecast. The app only supports a 24
hour format due to API limitations. Users can create an account and save cities they have searched for, for easy access to the weather.
